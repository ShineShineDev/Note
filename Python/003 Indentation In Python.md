## Indentation in Python 

> Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
>
> **`⚠️ The indentation in Python is very important.`**

- `Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.`
- `Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation`
- `You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error`
- `Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only but in python use for a block of code `





### Indentation  Example 

```js
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

// Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")

// You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")
```
