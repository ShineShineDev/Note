## Python Sets

- `Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.`

- `Set items are any data typ,unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.`

- `Set items can be of any data type`

  





### Create Sets

- `Sets are written with curly brackets.`

- `It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.`

  ```python
  st = {'dev',1,'programger',true}
  
  thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
  print(thisset)
  ```







### Length of a Set

- `To determine how many items a set has, use the len() method.`

  ```python
  thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
  print(len(thisset))
  ```







### Access Items

- `You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.`

- `But you can loop through the set items using a `for` loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.`

  ```python
  st = {'apple',1,'Shine Shine'};
  
  for el in st:
      print(el)
  ```

  





### Add Items

- `Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items with add() method.`

- `To add items from another set into the current set, we can also use the update() method.`

  ```python
  st = {'one',2,'three'};
  st.add(4)
  print(st)
  
  # To add items from another set into the current set, use the update() method.
  thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
  tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}
  thisset.update(tropical)
  print(thisset)
  ```

  





### Add Any Iterable

- `The object in the `update()` method does not have to be a set, it can be any iterable object (tuples, lists, dictionaries etc.)`

  ```python
  thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
  mylist = ["kiwi", "orange"]
  
  thisset.update(mylist)
  
  print(thisset)
  ```

  







### Remove Set Items

- `To remove an item in a set, use the remove(), or the discard() method.`

- `If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.`

- `The del keyword will delete the set completely`

  ```python
  #remove set item with remove method
  thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
  thisset.remove("banana")
  print(thisset)
  
  #remove set item with discard method
  thisset.discard("banana")
  print(thisset)
  
  #remove set with del keyword
  thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
  del thisset
  print(thisset)
  ```

  





### Loop Items

- `You can loop through the set items by using a for loop`

  ```python
  thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
  for x in thisset:
    print(x)
  ```

  





### Join Sets

- `There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.`

- `You can use the union() method that returns a new set containing all items from both sets`

- `the update() method that inserts all the items from one set into another`

- `Both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items.`

- `see more` https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets_join.asp

  ```python
  st1 = {'apple','banana','orange'}
  st2 = {'kiwi','blueberry','coconut'}
  # join with union method
  st3 = st1.union(st2)
  print(st3)
  # {'banana', 'kiwi', 'blueberry', 'apple', 'coconut', 'orange'}
  
  # join with union method
  st1.update(st2)
  print(st1)
  ```

  





### Check Item 

```python
st = {'apple',1,'Shine Shine'};    
res = 1 in st
print(res)
```









### Set Methods

- `Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on sets.`
