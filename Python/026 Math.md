## Math

- `Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.`





### Built-in Math Functions

- `The `**`min()`** and **`max()`** `functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable`

  ```python
  x = min(5, 10, 25) # find lowest value 
  y = max(5, 10, 25) # find highest value 
  x = abs(-7.25) # bsolute (positive) value of the specified number
  x = pow(4, 3) #he value of x to the power of y (xy).
  ```

  



### The Math Module

- `Python has also a built-in module called `**`math`.**

- `To use it, you must import the `math` module`

  ```python
  import math
  
  x = math.sqrt(64) #square root of a number
  x = math.ceil(1.4) #rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer
  y = math.floor(1.4) #rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer
  x = math.pi #returns the value of PI
  ```
