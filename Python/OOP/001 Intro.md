## OOP

- `OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming`
- `Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.`
- `Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of real objects`
- `OOP provides a clear structure for the programs`
- ` In traditional procedural programming funtions use varibales from different place this way your code maked spgaties code`
- `OOP Programming paradigm that follows real-world modelling(A car is an object that has data (make, model, number of doors, Vehicle Number, etc.) and functionality (accelerate, shift, open doors, turn on headlights, etc.)`
- `A program as a collection of objects that communicates with each other via mechanism called methods.`
- `The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions `
- `Object-oriented programming is based on the imperative programming paradigm`





###  Advantages of OOP

- `Reuse of code through inheritance (DRY) `

- `Flexibility through polymorphism `

- `Separation-of-concerns (Modularity) `

- `Problem solving thinking like real world`

- ` Design Benefits For Complex software architecture `

- `Software Maintenance`

- `Easy troubleshooting`

- `Better productivity. `





### Disadvantages of OOPs

-  `Learning curve`
- `Slower`
- `Uses more memory since more lines of code have to be written.`





### Core concepts of OOP 

- `Abstraction : displaying only essential information and hiding the details.Data abstraction can be used to provide security for the data from the unauthorized methods.`
- `Encapsulation  : bundling data and methods,that work on that data within a single unit. Encapsulation can be also used to hide both data and  methods member.we use Encapsulation to implement abstraction.Three access modifiers are private, public and protected.`
- `Inheritance : refers to a class able to inherit methods and properties from  parent class  . Inheritance creating clean and reusable code, avoiding repeats. `
- `Polymorphism : allows us to perform a single action in different ways. polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations( a method to do different things based on the object). Types of polymorphism and method overloading(static polymorphism) & overriding (dynamic polymorphism). `





### OOP features 

- `Class`

- `Object `

- `Property `

- `Methods `

- `Access modifier`

- `Getter and Setter`

- `Static`

- `Inheritance`

- `Interfaces `

- `Abstract`





### Is Python 100 percent object oriented?

- `Python doesn’t have access specifiers like “private” as in java. `
- `It supports most of the terms associated with “objected-oriented” programming language except strong encapsulation. Hence it is not fully object oriented.`






## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) vs Procedure Oriented Programming (POP)

The basic difference between OOP and procedural programming is-

- One way to think about POP is the same way you make lemonade for example. The procedure of making lemonade involves- first taking water according to the need, then adding sugar to the water, then adding lemon juice to the mixture, and finally mixing the whole solution. And your lemonade is ready to serve. In a similar way, POP requires a certain procedure of steps. A procedural program consists of functions. This means that in the POP approach the program is divided into functions, which are specific to different tasks. These functions are arranged in a specific sequence and the control of the program flows sequentially.
  Whereas an OOP program consists of objects. The object-Oriented approach divides the program into objects. And these objects are the entities that bundle up the properties and the behavior of the real-world objects.

- POP is suitable for small tasks only. Because as the length of the program increases, the complexity of the code also increases. And it ends up becoming a web of functions. Also, it becomes hard to debug. OOP solves this problem with the help of a clearer and less complex structure. It allows code re-usability in the form of inheritance.

- Another important thing is that in procedure-oriented programming all the functions have access to all the data, which implies a lack of security. Suppose you want to secure the credentials or any other critical information from the world. Then the procedural approach fails to provide you that security. For this OOP helps you with one of its amazing functionality known as **Encapsulation**, which allows us to hide data. Don’t worry I’ll cover this in detail in the latter part of this article along with other concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. For now, just understand that OOP enables security and POP does not.

- Programming languages like C, Pascal and BASIC use the procedural approach whereas Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, Scala, and C++ are the main languages that provide the Object-oriented approach.
