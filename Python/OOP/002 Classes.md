## Classes 

- `A Class is like an object constructor, or a blueprint for creating objects.`

- `Class can define properties and the methods common to all objects`

- `Class is no memory allocation until we create its` **object**

  






### Create a Class

- `All class definitions start with the `**`class`** `keyword, which is followed by the name of the class and a colon.`

- ` Any code that is indented below the class definition is considered part of the classâ€™s body.`

- **`class`** `definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a ` **`class`** `definition with no content, put in the `**`pass`** `statement to avoid getting an error.`

  ```python
  class Person:
      pass
  ```
