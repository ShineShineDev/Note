##  Property Shorthand



Object property shorthand **enables us to simply pass in the name of the key as opposed to repeating the name and the key**.

```js
/* Property Shorthand
- Object property shorthand enables us to simply pass in the name of the key as opposed to repeating the     name and the key.
*/
//PRE ES6
var myObject = {
  myKeyName: myKeyName
};
//ES6 Object property shorthand
var myObject = {
  myKeyName
};
```
