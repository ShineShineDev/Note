##### Create object with object literal

- `in JS you can create object with object literal `

  - ` But if you created one or moer Object by using Literal,code can duplicate     `
  - `let obj = {}`

  ```js
  let personOne = {
      name : 'person one', // propertie
      age : 21,  
      eat : function(){ // method
          return "Person one is eating";
      },
      // shoter syntax
      eatting(){
          return "Person one is eating";
      }
  }
  let personTwo = {
      name : 'person Two', // propertie
      age : 22,  
      eat : function(){ // duplicate method
          return "Person Two is eating";
      }
  }
  console.log(personOne.name);
  console.log(personOne.age)
  console.log(personOne.eat())
  personOne.eatting() 
  
  
  console.log(personTwo.name);
  console.log(personTwo.age)
  console.log(personTwo.eat())
  
  
  
  ```

----



##### Create object with factory function

  - `To create Object we can use Factory function`
  - `create function them return Object`

  ```js
  function person(name,age){
      return {
          name, // propertie
          age,
          eat : function(){ // method
             return `${name} is eating`;
          }
      }
  }
  
  const presonOne = person("shine shine",21)
  console.log(presonOne.name);
  console.log(presonOne.age)
  console.log(presonOne.eat())
  
  const presonTwo = person("shine shine Two",20)
  console.log(presonTwo.name);
  console.log(presonTwo.age)
  console.log(presonTwo.eat())
  ```

-----

  

  ##### Create object with object literal

  - `with Constructor function we can also create Object `

  - `According to naming convenction constructor function name start with first letter upper-case`

  - `create function them instead of returning an Object we must be use this keyword to reference cuurent created Object` 

    ```js
    function Person(name,age){
        this.name = name; // property
        this.age = age;
        this.eat = function(){ // method
              return `${this.name} is eating`;
        }
    }
    // add method with prototype is good way
    Person.prototype.methodWithPrototype = function(){
      return "method with prototype ";
    }
    
    let personOne = new Person("shine shine",21); /
    let personTwo = new Person("Tun Tun",20);
    console.log(personOne.name);
    console.log(personOne.age)
    console.log(personOne.eat())
    
    console.log(personTwo.name);
    
    console.log(personTwo.age)
    console.log(personTwo.eat())
    ```

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to using self-contained pieces of code to develop applications. We call these self-contained pieces of code **objects**, better known as *Classes* in most OOP programming languages and *Functions* in JavaScript. We use objects as building blocks for our applications. Building applications with objects allows us to adopt some valuable techniques, namely, **Inheritance** (objects can inherit features from other objects), **Polymorphism** (objects can share the same interface—how they are accessed and used—while their underlying implementation of the interface may differ), and **Encapsulation** (each object is responsible for specific tasks).



In this article, we are concerned with only Inheritance and Encapsulation since only these two concepts apply to OOP in JavaScript, particularly because, in JavaScript, objects can encapsulate functionalities and inherit methods and properties from other objects. Accordingly, in the rest of the article, I discuss everything you need to know about using objects in JavaScript in an object oriented manner—with inheritance and encapsulation—to easily reuse code and abstract functionalities into specialized objects.

We will focus **on only the best two techniques**1 for implementing OOP in JavaScript. Indeed, many techniques exist for implementing OOP in JavaScript, but rather than evaluate each, I choose to focus on the two best techniques: the best technique for creating objects with specialized functionalities (aka Encapsulation) and the best technique for reusing code (aka Inheritance). By “best” I mean the most apt, the most efficient, the most robust.



## Encapsulation and Inheritance Overview

 **Objects** can be thought of as the main actors in an application, or simply the main “things” or building blocks that do all the work. As you know by now, objects are everywhere in JavaScript since every component in JavaScript is an Object, including Functions, Strings, and Numbers. We normally use object literals or constructor functions to create objects.

**Encapsulation** refers to enclosing all the functionalities of an object within that object so that the object’s internal workings (its methods and properties) are hidden from the rest of the application. This allows us to abstract or localize specific set of functionalities on objects.

**Inheritance** refers to an object being able to inherit methods and properties from a parent object (a Class in other OOP languages, or a Function in JavaScript).

Both of these concepts, encapsulation and inheritance, are important because they allow us to build applications with reusable code, scalable architecture, and abstracted functionalities. Maintainable, scalable, efficient.

 An **instance** is an implementation of a Function. In simple terms, it is a copy (or “child”) of a Function or object. For example:

```
// Tree is a constructor function because we will use new keyword to invoke it.
function Tree (typeOfTree) {} 

// bananaTree is an instance of Tree.
var bananaTree = new Tree ("banana");
```

In the preceding example, *bananaTree* is an object that was created from the Tree constructor function. We say that the *bananaTree* object is an instance of the Tree object. Tree is both an object and a function, because functions are objects in JavaScript. *bananaTree* can have its own methods and properties and inherit methods and properties from the Tree object, as we will discuss in detail when we study inheritance below.

## OOP in JavaScript

The two important principles with OOP in JavaScript are Object Creation patterns (**Encapsulation**) and Code Reuse patterns (**Inheritance**). When building applications, you create many objects, and there exist many ways for creating these objects: you can use the ubiquitous object literal pattern, for example:

```
var myObj = {name: "Richard", profession: "Developer"}; 
```

You can use the prototype pattern, adding each method and property directly on the object’s prototype. For example: 

```
function Employee () {}

Employee.prototype.firstName = "Abhijit";
Employee.prototype.lastName = "Patel";
Employee.prototype.startDate = new Date();
Employee.prototype.signedNDA = true;
Employee.prototype.fullName = function () {
console.log (this.firstName + " " + this.lastName); 
};

var abhijit = new Employee () //
console.log(abhijit.fullName()); // Abhijit Patel
console.log(abhijit.signedNDA); // true
```

You can also use the constructor pattern, a constructor function (Classes in other languages, but Functions in JavaScript). For example: 

```
function Employee (name, profession) {
this.name = name;
this.profession = profession;
} // Employee () is the constructor function because we use the new keyword below to invoke it.

var richard = new Employee (“Richard”, “Developer”) // richard is a new object we create from the Employee () constructor function.

console.log(richard.name); //richard
console.log(richard.profession); // Developer
```

In the latter example, we use a custom constructor function to create an object. This is how we create objects when we want to add methods and properties on our objects, and when we want to encapsulate functionality on our objects. JavaScript developers have invented many patterns (or ways) for creating objects with constructor functions. And when we say Object Creation Patterns, we are concerned principally with the many ways of creating objects from constructor functions, as in the preceding example.

In addition to the patterns for creating objects, you want to reuse code efficiently. When you create your objects, you will likely want some of them to inherit (have similar functionality) methods and properties from a parent object, yet they should also have their own methods and properties. Code reuse patterns facilitate ways in which we can implement inheritance.

These two universal principles—creating objects (especially from constructor Functions) and allowing objects to inherit properties and methods—are the main focus of this article and, indeed, the main concepts with OOP in JavaScript. We first discuss the object creation pattern.

## Encapsulation in JavaScript

(The Best Object Creation Pattern: Combination Constructor/Prototype Pattern)

As discussed above, one of the main principles with OOP is encapsulation: put all the inner workings of an object inside that object. To implement encapsulation in JavaScript, we have to define the core methods and properties on that object. To do this, we will use the best pattern for encapsulation in **JavaScript: the Combination Constructor/Prototype Pattern**. This name is a mouthful, but you needn’t memorize it, since we are only concerned with its implementation. Before we implement it, let’s quickly learn a bit more about the practicality of encapsulation.

**Why Encapsulation?**
When you simply want to create an object just to store some data, and it is the only object of its kind, you can use an object literal and create your object. This is quite common and you will use this simple pattern often.

However, whenever you want to create objects with similar functionalities (to use the same methods and properties), you encapsulate the main functionalities in a Function and you use that Function’s constructor to create the objects. This is the essence of encapsulation. And it is this need for encapsulation that we are concerned with and why we are using the Combination Constructor/Prototype Pattern.

To make practical use of OOP in JavaScript, we will build an object-oriented quiz application that uses all the principles and techniques we learn in this article. First up, our quiz application will have users (a **Users** Function) who take the quiz. There will be some common properties for every user who takes the quiz: each user will have a *name*, a *score*, an *email*, and the *quiz scores* (all the scores). These are the properties of the User object. In addition, each User object should be able to show the name and score, save scores, and change the email. These are the methods of the object.

Because we want ALL the user objects to have these same properties and methods, we cannot use the object literal way of creating objects. We have to use a constructor Function to encapsulate these properties and methods.

Since we know all users will have the same set of properties, it makes sense to create a Function (Class in OOP languages) that encapsulates these properties and methods. Thus, we will use the Combination Constructor/Prototype Pattern for this.

**Implementation of Combination Constructor/Prototype Pattern**
The User Function:

I will explain each line.

```
function User (theName, theEmail) {
    this.name = theName;
    this.email = theEmail;
    this.quizScores = [];
    this.currentScore = 0;
}

User.prototype = {
    constructor: User,
    saveScore:function (theScoreToAdd)  {
        this.quizScores.push(theScoreToAdd)
    },
    showNameAndScores:function ()  {
        var scores = this.quizScores.length > 0 ? this.quizScores.join(",") : "No Scores Yet";
        return this.name + " Scores: " + scores;
    },
    changeEmail:function (newEmail)  {
        this.email = newEmail;
        return "New Email Saved: " + this.email;
    }
}
```

**Make Instances of the User function**

```
// A User 
firstUser = new User("Richard", "Richard@examnple.com"); 
firstUser.changeEmail("RichardB@examnple.com");
firstUser.saveScore(15);
firstUser.saveScore(10); 

firstUser.showNameAndScores(); //Richard Scores: 15,10

// Another User
secondUser = new User("Peter", "Peter@examnple.com");
secondUser.saveScore(18);
secondUser.showNameAndScores(); //Peter Scores: 18
```

**Explanation of Combination Constructor/Prototype Pattern**
Let’s expound on each line of code so we have a thorough understanding of this pattern.

The following lines initialize the instance properties. These properties will be defined on each User instance that is created. So the values will be different for each user. The use of the this keyword inside the function specifies that these properties will be unique to every instance of the User object:

```
this.name = theName;
this.email = theEmail;
this.quizScores = [];
this.currentScore = 0;
```

In the code below, we are overwriting the prototype property with an object literal, and we define all of our methods (that will be inherited by all the User instances) in this object. Discussion continues after the code:

```
User.prototype = {
    constructor: User,
    saveScore:function (theScoreToAdd)  {
        this.quizScores.push(theScoreToAdd)
    },
    showNameAndScores:function ()  {
        var scores = this.quizScores.length > 0 ? this.quizScores.join(",") : "No Scores Yet";
        return this.name + " Scores: " + scores;
    },
    changeEmail:function (newEmail)  {
        this.email = newEmail;
        return "New Email Saved: " + this.email;
    }
}
```

This way of overwriting the constructor is simply for convenience, so we don’t have to write User.prototype each time, like this: 

```
User.prototype.constructor = User;
User.prototype.saveScore = function (theScoreToAdd)  {
    this.quizScores.push(theScoreToAdd)
};

User.prototype.showNameAndScores = function ()  {
    var scores = this.quizScores.length > 0 ? this.quizScores.join(",") : "No Scores Yet";
    return this.name + " Scores: " + scores;
};

User.prototype.changeEmail =  function (newEmail)  {
    this.email = newEmail;
    return "New Email Saved: " + this.email;
}
```

By overwriting the prototype with a new object literal we have all the methods organized in one place, and you can better see the encapsulation that we are after. And of course it is less code you have to type.

**JavaScript Prototype**
In JavaScript, you add methods and properties on the prototype property when you want instances of an object to inherit those methods and properties. This is the reason we add the methods on the User.prototype property, so that they can be used by all instances of the User object. Read more about [JavaScript Prototype in Plain Language](http://70.32.104.226/~javascriptissexy/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/).



**Constructor Property**
In my post JavaScript Prototype, I explained that every function has a constructor property, and this property points to the constructor of the function. For example:

```
function Fruit () {}
var newFruit = new Fruit ();
console.log (newFruit.constructor) // Fruit ()
```

The one disadvantage of overwriting the prototype is that the constructor property no longer points to the prototype, so we have to set it manually. Hence this line:

```
 constructor: User
```

**Prototype Methods**
In the following lines, we create methods on the prototype (in the object literal) so that all instances of Users can have access to these methods.

```
saveScore:function (theScoreToAdd)  {
        this.quizScores.push(theScoreToAdd)
    },
    showNameAndScores:function ()  {
        var scores = this.quizScores.length > 0 ? this.quizScores.join(",") : "No Scores Yet";
        return this.name + " Scores: " + scores;
    },
    changeEmail:function (newEmail)  {
        this.email = newEmail;
        return "New Email Saved: " + this.email;
    }
```

We then created instances of the User object:

```
// A User 
firstUser = new User("Richard", "Richard@examnple.com"); 
firstUser.changeEmail("RichardB@examnple.com");
firstUser.saveScore(15);
firstUser.saveScore(10); 

firstUser.showNameAndScores(); //Richard Scores: 15,10

// Another User
secondUser = new User("Peter", "Peter@examnple.com");
secondUser.saveScore(18);
secondUser.showNameAndScores(); //Peter Scores: 18
```

As you see, we have encapsulated all the functionality for a User inside the User Function, so that each instance of User can make use of the prototype methods (like changeEmail) and define their own instance properties (like name and email).

With this pattern, you can use the standard operators and methods on the instances, including the instanceOf operator, the for-in loop (even hasOwnProperty), and the constructor property.

## Inheritance in JavaScript

(The Best Pattern: Parasitic Combination Inheritance)

Implementing inheritance in our quiz application will permit us to inherit functionality from parent Functions so that we can easily reuse code in our application and extend the functionality of objects. Objects can make use of their inherited functionalities and still have their own specialized functionalities.

The best pattern for implementing inheritance in JavaScript is the Parasitic Combination inheritance 2. Before we dive into this awesome pattern, let’s see why its practical to use inheritance in our applications.

We have successfully implemented encapsulation by enclosing all the functionality for users of our quiz application by adding all the methods and properties that each user will need on the User function, and all instances of User will have those properties and methods.

### Why Inheritance?

Next, we want to encapsulate all the functionalities for every Question. The Question function (Class in OOP languages) will have all the generic properties and methods that every kind of question will need to have. For example, every question will have the question, the choices, and the correct answer. These will be the properties. In addition, each question will have some methods: getCorrectAnswer and getUserAnswer, and displayQuestion.

We want our quiz application to make different types of Questions. We will implement a MultipleChoiceQuestion function and a DragDropQuestion function. To implement these, it would not make sense to put the properties and methods outlined above (that all questions will use) inside the MultipleChoiceQuestion and DragDropQuestion functions separately, repeating the same code. This would be redundant.

Instead, we will leave those properties and methods (that all questions will use) inside the Question object and make the MultipleChoiceQuestion and DragDropQuestion functions inherit those methods and properties. This is where inheritance is important: we can reuse code throughout our application effectively and better maintain our code.

Since the MultipleChoiceQuestion HTML layout and will be different from the DragDropQuestion HTML layout, the displayQuestion method will be implemented differently in each. So we will override the displayQuestion method on the DragDropQuestion. Overriding functions is another principle of OOP.

**Lets Code.**

## Implementing the Parasitic Combination Inheritance Pattern

To implement this pattern, we have to use two techniques that were invented specifically for inheritance in JavaScript. Some notes about these techniques follow. No need to memorize any of the detail; just understand and be aware of the techniques.

### *Prototypal Inheritance* by Douglas Crockford

Douglas Crockford created the following Object.create method 3, used in a fundamental way to implementing inheritance with the pattern we are using.

**Object.create method**
Ruminate on the method Crockford created:

```
 if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') {
    Object.create = function (o) {
        function F() {
        }

        F.prototype = o;
        return new F();
    };
}
```

This method has been added to the ECMAScript5 specification, and you can access it with Object.create (). Let’s quickly understand it is doing.

```
Object.create = function (o) {
//It creates a temporary constructor F()
        function F() {
        }
//And set the prototype of the this constructor to the parametric (passed-in) o object
//so that the F() constructor now inherits all the properties and methods of o
        F.prototype = o;

//Then it returns a new, empty object (an instance of F())
//Note that this instance of F inherits from the passed-in (parametric object) o object. 
//Or you can say it copied all of the o object's properties and methods
        return new F();
    }
```

The crux of the matter with this Object.create method is that you pass into it an object that you want to inherit from, and it returns a new object that inherits from the object you passed into it. For example:

```
// We have a simple cars object
var cars = {
    type:"sedan",
    wheels:4
};

// We want to inherit from the cars object, so we do:
var toyota = Object.create (cars); // now toyota inherits the properties from cars
console.log(toyota.type); // sedan
```

Of course we can now add more properties to the toyota object, but let’s move on.

The next function we will use for inheritance is the **inheritPrototype** function. This function succinctly implements the parasitic combination inheritance for us. We pass in the parent object (or Super Class) and the child object (or Sub Class), and the function does the parasitic combination inheritance: makes the child object inherits from the parent object.

```
 function inheritPrototype(childObject, parentObject) {
    // As discussed above, we use the Crockford’s method to copy the properties and methods from the parentObject onto the childObject
// So the copyOfParent object now has everything the parentObject has 
    var copyOfParent = Object.create(parentObject.prototype);

    //Then we set the constructor of this new object to point to the childObject.
// Why do we manually set the copyOfParent constructor here, see the explanation immediately following this code block.
    copyOfParent.constructor = childObject;

    // Then we set the childObject prototype to copyOfParent, so that the childObject can in turn inherit everything from copyOfParent (from parentObject)
   childObject.prototype = copyOfParent;
}
```

**Why did we manually set the copyOfParent.constructor?**
________________________________________
We explicitly set the *copyOfParent.constructor* property to point to the childObject constructor because in the preceding step, var copyOfParent = Object.create(parentObject.prototype), this is what we actually did:

```
// We made a new object and overwrote its prototype with the parentObject prototype:
function F() {
        }
F.prototype = parentObject.prototype;
// Then it was this new F object we assigned to copyOfParent.
// All of this was done inside the Object.create () method.
```

So, this new F object, which we assigned to copyOfParent, doesn’t have a constructor property anymore because we overwrote its entire prototype. Whenever you overwrite an object’s prototype (object.prototype = someVal), you also overwrite the object’s constructor property.

To make sure we have the correct value for copyOfParent constructor, we set it manually with this:
**copyOfParent.constructor = childObject;**

A commenter by the name of John correctly pointed our that I did not corruptly explain this bit, hence this detailed explanation.
________________________________________

Essentially, we are copying all the properties and methods from the parentObject to the childObject, but we are using the copyOfParent as an intermediary for the copy. And because the childObject prototype was overwritten during the copy, we manually set the copyOfParent constructor to the childObject. Then we set the childObject prototype to the copyOfParent so that the childObject inherits from the parentObject.

Okay, that was quite a bit. I am hopeful you understand some of that :).

**Back to the fun stuff: Creating our quiz OOP style.**
Now that we understand the inheritPrototype function we will be using, lets go ahead and implement our Question constructor.

Note that I use “constructor” and “function” interchangeably sometimes in this particular article when referring to the function, because the function will be used as a constructor to create instances.

**The Question Constructor (Parent of all Question Objects):**
(Can be thought of as the Super Class for Questions)

```
 // The Question function is the parent for all other question objects;
// All question objects will inherit from this Question constructor

function Question(theQuestion, theChoices, theCorrectAnswer) {
    // Initialize the instance properties
    this.question = theQuestion;
    this.choices = theChoices;
    this.correctAnswer = theCorrectAnswer;
    this.userAnswer = "";

    // private properties: these cannot be changed by instances
    var newDate = new Date(),
    // Constant variable: available to all instances through the instance method below. This is also a private property.
        QUIZ_CREATED_DATE = newDate.toLocaleDateString();

// This is the only way to access the private QUIZ_CREATED_DATE variable 
// This is an example of a privilege method: it can access private properties and it can be called publicly
    this.getQuizDate = function () {
        return QUIZ_CREATED_DATE;
    };

// A confirmation message that the question was created
    console.log("Quiz Created On: " + this.getQuizDate());

}
```

**Add Prototype Methods to The Question Object**
All instances of the Question object will inherit these methods, because we are adding the methods on the Question prototype.

```
 // Define the prototype methods that will be inherited
Question.prototype.getCorrectAnswer = function () {
    return  this.correctAnswer;
};

Question.prototype.getUserAnswer = function () {
    return this.userAnswer;
};

Question.prototype.displayQuestion = function () {
    var questionToDisplay = "" + this.question + "";
        choiceCounter = 0;

    this.choices.forEach(function (eachChoice)  {
        questionToDisplay += '' + eachChoice + '';
        choiceCounter++;
    });
    questionToDisplay += "";

    console.log (questionToDisplay);
}; 
```

**Child Questions (Sub Classes of the Question object)**
Now that we have the Question constructor object setup, we can inherit from it and create sub classes (children objects). The power of inheritance is that we can create all sorts of questions now, and each can be quite versatile.

First, a **Multiple Choice Question:**

```
// Create the MultipleChoiceQuestion
function MultipleChoiceQuestion(theQuestion, theChoices, theCorrectAnswer){
// For MultipleChoiceQuestion to properly inherit from Question, here inside the MultipleChoiceQuestion constructor, we have to explicitly call the Question constructor
// passing MultipleChoiceQuestion as the this object, and the parameters we want to use in the Question constructor:
    Question.call(this, theQuestion, theChoices, theCorrectAnswer);
};
```

And then we have to use the inheritPrototype function we discussed moments ago:

```
// inherit the methods and properties from Question
inheritPrototype(MultipleChoiceQuestion, Question);
```

**After** we have inherited from Question, we then add methods to the MultipleChoiceQuestion function, if necessary. But we must do it after we inherit, not before, or all the methods we define on its prototype will be overwritten. We are not adding any now.

**A Drag and Drop Question**
In a similar manner, we can make yet another type of question:

```
// Create the DragDropQuestion
function DragDropQuestion(theQuestion, theChoices, theCorrectAnswer) {
    Question.call(this, theQuestion, theChoices, theCorrectAnswer);
}

// inherit the methods and properties from Question
inheritPrototype(DragDropQuestion, Question);
```

Overriding Methods
Overriding methods is a another principle of OOP, and we can do it easily with this pattern. Since the Drag and Drop questions will have a different HTML layout from the Multiple Choice questions (no radio buttons, for example), we can override the displayQuestion method so it operates specifically to the Drag and Drop question needs:

```
// Override the displayQuestion method it inherited
DragDropQuestion.prototype.displayQuestion = function () {
    // Just return the question. Drag and Drop implementation detail is beyond this article
    console.log(this.question);
};
```

In our real Quiz application, we would create a Quiz constructor that is the main application that launches the quiz, but in this article, we can test our inheritance code by simply doing this:

```
// Initialize some questions and add them to an array
var allQuestions = [
new MultipleChoiceQuestion("Who is Prime Minister of England?", ["Obama", "Blair", "Brown", "Cameron"], 3),
   
new MultipleChoiceQuestion("What is the Capital of Brazil?", ["São Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro", "Brasília"], 2),
   
new DragDropQuestion("Drag the correct City to the world map.", ["Washington, DC", "Rio de Janeiro", "Stockholm"], 0)
];

// Display all the questions
allQuestions.forEach(function (eachQuestion)  {
    eachQuestion.displayQuestion();
});
```

If you run the code, you will see that the displayQuestion for the multiple choice questions returns the **question** in a div tag, with **choices** formatted with radio buttons inside li tags. On the other hand, the drag and drop questions displayQuestion method simply returns the **question** without the choices.

Nicholas Zakas stated it wonderfully, “Parasitic combination inheritance is considered the most optimal inheritance paradigm” 5 in JavaScript. If you learn it and understand it well, you should use it in your JavaScript web applications.

You might be wondering how is the Combination Constructor/Prototype Pattern we used for Encapsulation earlier different from the Parasitic Combination Inheritance. They are similar, but the former is best used for encapsulation (creating custom objects), and it does not have all the inheritance mechanisms such as subclassing (creating child constructors that inherit from the parent constructor). Moreover, the inheritance pattern goes beyond setting up objects to just inherit properties and methods, it enables child objects to themselves be parent objects of other objects, and you can use private members, overriding, and other OOP concepts.

## Final Words

I gave you the full details for implementing the best two patterns for OOP in JavaScript, and I am hopeful you understood at least the general concepts. Go use these patterns in your JavaScript applications. Note that you can use OOP in even small and medium applications, not just complex applications.

Be good and do good work, and take care of yourself: sleep well, eat well, and enjoy life.
