## What is OOP

- `OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming`

- `Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of real objects, that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.`

- ` In traditional procedural programming funtions use varibales from different place this way your code maked spgaties code`

- `The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions `

  





## Advantages of OOP

- `Reuse of code through inheritance (DRY) `

- `Flexibility through polymorphism `

- `Separation-of-concerns (Modularity) `

- `Problem solving thinking like real world`

- `Combine into a single unit (data and the methods ) Encapsulation `

- ` Design Benefits For Complex software architecture `

- `Software Maintenance`

- `Easy troubleshooting`

- `Better productivity. `

- `Clear structure for the programs`

  

## Core concepts of OOP 

- `Abstraction : displaying only essential information and hiding the details.Data abstraction can be used to provide security for the data from the unauthorized methods.`
- `Encapsulation  : bundling data and methods,that work on that data within a single unit. Encapsulation can be also used to hide both data and  methods member.we use Encapsulation to implement abstraction.Three access modifiers are private, public and protected.`
- `Inheritance : refers to a class able to inherit methods and properties from  parent class  . Inheritance creating clean and reusable code, avoiding repeats. `
- `Polymorphism : allows us to perform a single action in different ways. polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations( a method to do different things based on the object). Types of polymorphism and method overloading(static polymorphism) & overriding (dynamic polymorphism). `



## OOP features 

- `Class`

- `Object `

- `Property `

- `Methods `

- `Access modifier`

- `Getter and Setter`

- `Static`

- `Inheritance`

- `Interfaces `

- `Abstract`

## OOP In JS

- `JavaScript is a prototype-based object oriented programming.`
- `But  ES6 is  introduce  class keyword to create class just like other programing language(class-based programming)`
