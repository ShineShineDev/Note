##                  Object-Oriented Programming Concepts







### Programming paradigm

- `Programming paradigm  is a style of programming, a way of thinking about software construction.`







### OOP Programming(OOP)  Paradigm

- `Object oriented programming (OOP) is a programming  paradigm based on the concept of real world object`

- `For example: A car is an object that has data (make, model, number of doors, Vehicle Number, etc.) and functionality (accelerate, shift, open doors, turn on headlights, etc.)`

  




### Procedural Programming (PP) Paradigm

- `Procedural(routines, subroutines, inline or functions) programming is a programming  paradigm. `
- `It uses a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step-by-step instructions like algorithm.`
- `Procedural programming is also referred to as imperative programming and also known as top-down languages. `





### Functional programming (FP) Paradigm

- `Functional programming (FP) is programing paradigm and it is  about passing data from function to function to function to get a result.`
- `They should avoid shared state, and side effects and data should be immutable.`







### Advantages  of OOP 

- `Simplicity(Problem solving thinking like real world`)

- `Flexibility(Polomorphsim)`
- `Modularity (abstraction)`
- `Security(data hiding and encapsulation )`
- `Combine into a single unit (data and the methods ) Encapsulation `
- `Reuse of code (inheritance) (DRY) `
- ` Design Benefits For Complex software architecture `
- `Software Maintenance`
- `Easy troubleshooting`
- `Better productivity. `





### Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

- `Class`

- `Objects(Properties and Method)`

- `Encapsulation`

- `Abstract class`

- `Inheritance`

- `Polymorphism`

- `Interfaces`

  

  







## OOP in Dart

- `In Dart, everything is an object, including the built-in types. Upon defining a new class, even when you don't extend anything, it will be a *descendant of an object*. Dart implicitly does this for you.`
- `Dart is called a true object-oriented language. Even functions are objects`
- `Another important point to note is that Dart supports *single inheritance* on a class, similar to Java and most other languages, which means that a class can inherit directly from only a single class at a time.`
- `A class can implement multiple interfaces and extend multiple classes using mixins, which we will cover later in this chapter.`
- `Here are the main OOP artifacts that are presented in the Dart language (we will delve deeper into each throughout this chapter):`
  - **Class**: `This is a blueprint for creating an object.`
  - **Interface**: `This is a contract definition with a set of methods available on an object. Although there is no explicit interface type in Dart, we can achieve the interface purpose with abstract classes.`
  - **Enumerated class**: `This is a special kind of class that defines a set of common constant values.`
  - **Mixin**: `This is a way of reusing a class's code in multiple class hierarchies.`
