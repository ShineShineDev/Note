## Comments

- `Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.`

- `Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`).

- `Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */`

  ```java
  class Post{
      public static void main(String[] args){
          // This is a comment
          System.out.println("Hello World!");
          
          /* The code below will print the words Hello World
          	to the screen, and it is amazing */
          System.out.println(358);
      }
  }
  
  
  System.out.println("Hello World");
