## What Is Nuxt.js?

- `Nuxt.js is a  free and open source server-side rendering framework built on Vue.js,Node.js, Webpack and Babel.js`
- `Nuxt is inspired by Next.js, which is a framework of similar purpose, based on React.js.`
- ` The framework is advertised as a "Meta-framework for universal applications`
- `It abstracts away most of the complex configuration involved in managing asynchronous data, middleware, and routing. It also helps structure Vue.js applications using industry-standard architecture for building simple or enterprise Vue.js applications.`





#### What Is Nuxt.js Used For?

- `Nuxt.js allows you to create many different kinds of applications. Below are the three most popular applications made with Nuxt.js.`

-  `Static Generated Pages`

  `This type of website does not require any external content source — the content is already embedded in the HTML. Examples of such websites include portfolio, demo, and tutorial websites.`
  
- `Single-Page Applications (SPA)`

  `This frontend development approach fetches dynamic content from an external API and displays it on the client-side. Most JavaScript framework such as React.js, Vue.js, Angula, and Ember.js are all single-page application frameworks.`

  `What’s more, a SPA’s routing system is achieved with HTML 5 History API or the location hash for routing, which gives developers the ability to modify a website’s URL without a full page refresh.`

- `Universal Applications`

  `Universal application” is a term that describes the use of a server-side rendering approach to fetch client-side data on the server before fully rendering the page on the client browser.`

  `Server-side rendering (SSR) is a known issue in Vue.js because it involves tedious configurations to get it right.`

  `Nuxt.js solves the SSR problem in Vue.js, which is helpful for search engine optimization (SEO). Nuxt.js can even extend Universal applications to accommodate a full-fledged monolith application, where the frontend and backend share a single codebase.`
