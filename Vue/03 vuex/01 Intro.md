## What is vuex

- `Vuex is State management pattern + library for Vue`
-  `Centralized store for all the components `
-  `Vuex uses a single state tree, single object contains all your application level state and serves as the "single source of truth"`
-  `Easy to learn`
-  `Similar to redux,flux, etc.`
-  `No need to pass events up and props down in multiple components`
-  `Global state is reactive`
