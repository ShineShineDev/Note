As maintainer of the Node.js driver, Christian saw more Node.js+MongoDB code bases than anyone, and his experience is unmatched. This book distills 6 years of hard-learned lessons into concrete examples of how to design MongoDB schemas for massive scale. If you want to learn how to structure MongoDB schemas for an ecommerce store, a category tree, or a blog that can support hundreds of millions of requests per day, this is the book for you.`
