> **`MongoDB`** `is is one of the most popular NoSQL(document database) database for the scalability and flexibility`
>
> ` MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time unlike your RDBMS where it stores the data in relational format(tabled-structure)`
>
> `You can download a free MongoDB database at` [https://www.mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/)`or get started right away with a MongoDB cloud service at` https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas.
>
> **`Mongoose`** `is an Object Document Mapper(ODM) package or object modeling tool `
>
> **`Mongoose`** `provides a simple schema-based solution to model your app data,that is mapped to a MongoDB document. `

> ` It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.`







### [What is the best way to interact with a database?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose#what_is_the_best_way_to_interact_with_a_database)

- `There are two common approaches for interacting with a database: `

  - **`Native query language (e.g. SQL)`** `and`
  - **` Object Data Model (ODM) or an Object Relational Model (ORM)`**

  





### Native query language 

- `Using the databases' native query language they are very best performance,that can be gained by using SQL or whatever query language is supported by the database `







### Object Data Model or Object Relational Model (ODM or ORM )

- `An ODM/ORM represents the website's data` **`as JavaScript objects`**, `which are then mapped to the underlying database`.
- ` Some ORMs are tied to a specific database, while others provide a database-agnostic backend.`
-  `ODM's are often` **`slower`**` because they use translation code to map between objects and the database format, `
- `Using ODM/ORMs often results in` **`lower costs for development and maintenance`**! `Unless you're very familiar with the native query language or performance is paramount`
- `The benefit of using an ORM is that` **`programmers can continue to think in terms of JavaScript objects rather than database semantics`** â€” `this is particularly true if you need to work with different databases (on either the same or different websites).`









### [What ORM/ODM should I use?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose#what_ormodm_should_i_use)

- `There are many ODM/ORM solutions available on the NPM package manager site (check out the` [odm](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/odm) and [orm](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/orm) `tags for a subset!).`
- `A few solutions that were popular at the time of writing are:`
  - [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose): `Mongoose is a` [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) `object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.`
  - [Waterline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/waterline): `An ORM extracted from the Express-based` [Sails](http://sailsjs.com/) `web framework. It provides a uniform API for accessing numerous different databases, including Redis, MySQL, LDAP, MongoDB, and Postgres.`
  - [Bookshelf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bookshelf): `Features both promise-based and traditional callback interfaces, providing transaction support, eager/nested-eager relation loading, polymorphic associations, and support for one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relations. Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite3.`
  - [Objection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/objection): `Makes it as easy as possible to use the full power of SQL and the underlying database engine (supports SQLite3, Postgres, and MySQL).`
  - [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) `is a promise-based ORM for Node.js and io.js. It supports the dialects PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and MSSQL and features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.`
  - [Node ORM2](https://node-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) `is an Object Relationship Manager for NodeJS. It supports MySQL, SQLite, and Progress, helping to work with the database using an object-oriented approach.`
  - [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/): `Primarily a query language for restful APIs, GraphQL is very popular, and has features available for reading data from databases.`



### Built With Mongoose

> `According to` [GitHub](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose), `there are over 870,000 projects that depend on Mongoose. Here are a few of our favorite apps that are built with Mongoose.`
