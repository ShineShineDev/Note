### What is the Raspberry Pi?

> `The Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable, and amazingly capable, credit card size computer.`
>
> `It is developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and it might be the most versatile tech ever created.`
>
> `Creator Eben Upton's goal was to create a low-cost device that would improve programming skills and hardware understanding.`
>
> `Due to the small size and price of the device, it has become the center of a wide range of projects by tinkerers, makers, and electronics enthusiasts.`
>
> `The Raspberry Pi has a row of GPIO (General Purpose input/output) pins, and these can be used to interact in amazing ways with the real world. `
