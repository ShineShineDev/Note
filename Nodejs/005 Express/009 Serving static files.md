# Serving Static Files with Express 

> `To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the ` **`express.static`** `built-in middleware function`
>
> `We have created a directory with the name of public and express will automatically server all the files in the folder`



- `express.static(root, [options])`
- `The `**`root`** `argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets`
- `Express, by default does not allow you to serve static files. You need to enable it using the following built-in middleware.`

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = exexpress();

app.use(express.static('public'))

app.listen(8080,(err)=>{
    if(err) return console.log('Server runnning on port 8080');
})

// load the files that are in the public directory:
http://localhost:3000/node.png
http://localhost:3000/ex.png
```

> `To use multiple static assets directories, call the `**`express.static`** `middleware function multiple times`





#### Create a virtual path 

> `To create a virtual path prefix (where the path does not actually exist in the file system) for files that are served by the `express.static` function, [specify a mount path](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.use) for the static directory

```js
app.use('/static', express.static('public'))

// load the files that are in the public directory:
http://localhost:3000/static/node.png
http://localhost:3000/static/ex.png
```





#### Best practice for serving static  file

>  `the path that you provide to the` **`express.static`** `function is relative to the directory from where you launch your node process. If you run the express app from another directory, itâ€™s safer to use the absolute path of the directory that you want to serve`

```js
 app.use('/static', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))) // best practice
```
