## What 

- `TypeScript is a syntactic` **`superset of JavaScript`** `which adds` **`static typing.`**



### Why 

- `JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.`
- `TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.`

> `The main reason for using TypeScript is` **`to add static typing to JavaScript`** `Static typing means that the type of a variable cannot be changed at any point in a program.` 



### JavaScript vs TypeScript

```typescript
// JavaScript
let foo = "hello";
foo = 55; // foo has changed type from a string to a number - no problem

// TypeScript
let foo = "hello";
foo = 55; // ERROR - foo cannot change from string to number
```
